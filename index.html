            I am visual designer or problem solver. I figuring out the best way to convey a message. This is how I approach every project. It doesn’t matter if it’s a greeting card or an animated graphic, or website to me it’s all the same. It’s creating something to solve a problem and communicate information.

            <!--<h3>Concept</h3>
            
            <p>The first step in any project is research. Figuring out what needs to be conveyed. This step involves research, looking at competitors and coming up with ideas.</p>-->

                I love Traveling and exploring new places. I think it's important to remember that we are apart of a much bigger world. This year I am planning on going to Japan.

            <!--<h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>This is where I present my findings and ask for feedback. Communication is a really important part of my design process. I need to make sure what I am designing solves your problem.</p>-->
            <p>One of my main hobbies is baking. I started baking cupcakes when I was 16. I have moved on to pies, cookies, and layered cakes. I hope that one day soon I will be able to tackle bread.</p>

           <!-- <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>I take all the research and feedback I recieve and putting it together to create the design. It's more than just making something "look nice" it's about creating something that has meaning and function.</p>-->
            <p>I am a complete type nerd. I like working with letters and love creating them. Hand lettering is something I picked up in the past few years. I enjoy going to typography workshops and even attended Letter West this past year.</p>
